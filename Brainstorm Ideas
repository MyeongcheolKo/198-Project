Brainstorm Ideas

- wrist shake + heart rate detection 
- train a ml model to detect abnormal activities 

Perfect — so you want to design an IoT monitoring platform for nurses to quickly see which patients show abnormal activity patterns (like sleep/wake disturbances that may suggest delirium or other problems).

Here’s how you could structure it:

⸻

🏥 IoT Patient Monitoring Platform for Abnormal Activities

1. Patient Devices (Edge Layer)
 • Each patient wears a smart wristband (accelerometer-based, like an actigraph).
 • The device collects:
 • Motion/activity counts
 • Immobility periods (possible sleep episodes)
 • Optional: heart rate, oxygen saturation

💡 Hardware: ESP32 + accelerometer, or off-the-shelf medical wearables.

⸻

2. Communication Layer
 • Devices send data via Wi-Fi / BLE → Gateway → Internet.
 • Lightweight protocol MQTT is ideal for real-time health data.

⸻

3. Backend & Cloud Processing
 • Central IoT platform collects and analyzes data:
 • Compare day vs. night activity for each patient.
 • Apply thresholds or ML models to detect abnormal patterns (e.g., no day–night difference, excessive immobility, irregular movement).
 • Store historical data for trend analysis.

💡 Options:
 • Open-source: Node-RED, ThingsBoard, InfluxDB + Grafana
 • Cloud: AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub, Google Cloud IoT

⸻

4. Nurse Dashboard (Application Layer)
 • A web or tablet dashboard that lists all patients in a ward.
 • Key features:
 • Patient list with status colors:
 • 🟢 Normal activity
 • 🟡 Borderline patterns
 • 🔴 Abnormal (flagged for nurse attention)
 • Click a patient → see activity graph (day/night).
 • Historical trends to check if delirium risk is increasing.
 • Real-time alerts/notifications (SMS, app notification).

⸻

5. Alerting System
 • If abnormality is detected → alert the nurse immediately.
 • Alerts can be:
 • Pop-up on dashboard
 • Text notification
 • Integration with hospital paging system

⸻

✅ Example Workflow
 1. Patient wears IoT wristband.
 2. Data sent to hospital IoT server via MQTT.
 3. System analyzes activity (e.g., patient not moving much during day).
 4. If abnormal → flag in nurse dashboard + send alert.
 5. Nurse checks flagged patients first, improving efficiency.

⸻

⚡ End Goal: Nurses don’t have to manually check every patient. Instead, they just glance at the dashboard and instantly know who needs attention.

👉 Do you want me to design a sample dashboard mockup (layout: patient list, status indicators, graphs) so you can show how the nurses would see the data?
